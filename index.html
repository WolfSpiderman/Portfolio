            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Joshua Jenkins! For the past decade, I've worked in restaurants, primarily as a bartender, which has given me plenty of experience in working with others and customer satisfaction.
                I got into coding because I've been ready for a change for a while now, and finally found a field that feels right for me. 
                I enjoy the challenges of both building something from scratch, and of analyzing something that doesn't work, figuring it out, and fixing it.
                My primary goal in life is to do whatever I can to help the human race move forward, not backward, whether that means finding some way to help find the cure for cancer, or helping in the efforts towards post-humanism, or just being a good person.
                In my free time, I enjoy video games, comedy, podcasts, and cooking.
